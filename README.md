# Another-Platformer

This is a very simple platformer I built in 5 days to learn some basics and get practice in making frame based games. While it is mechanically simple, there are a lot of precise jumps and techniques you can use to shave off time and an in game timer that ticks up a second for every 60th frame and I had a lot of fun trying to get the lowest time I could. I ended up settling on a 2:00 flat for my best time but I'm sure that it could go a good bit lower. All of the artwork other than the player character was made by me in Aseprite, the player character is from the Python Arcade libraries built in assets.

You can download the .exe file in the main directory and run it to play the game. The A and D keys move your character left and right, SPACE key jumps, W and S move you up and down on a ladder, R resets the current stage without resetting the timer, and L completely resets the game to level 1 with 0 seconds on the timer. I hope you have fun with it!


IMPORTANT NOTE!
I've had trouble with pyinstaller being detected as virus software when using --onefile to package everything into a single .exe file for user simplicity, so I've had to create build folders/files. It's less convenient but I've compressed them so you can download it as one .rar, and when you decompress it you can go into the dist folder and make a shortcut of the practice_platformer.exe file to put where ever you like and launch the program. Sorry for the inconvenience!
