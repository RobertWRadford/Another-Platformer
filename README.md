# Another-Platformer

This is a very simple platformer I built in 5 days to learn some basics and get practice in making frame based games. While it is mechanically simple, there are a lot of precise jumps and techniques you can use to shave off time and an in game timer that ticks up a second for every 60th frame and I had a lot of fun trying to get the lowest time I could. I ended up settling on a 2:32 for my best time but I'm sure that it could go a good bit lower. All of the artwork other than the player character was made by me in Aseprite, the player character is from the Python Arcade libraries built in assets.

## To Download and Play

Click on the practice_platformer.rar filename, and then in the upper right of the file information box hit download, and then decompress it. Then you can make a shortcut of the practice_platformer.exe file in the practice_platofrmer folder you decompressed and put it where ever you like and launch the program with it.

The A and D keys move your character left and right, SPACE key jumps, W and S move you up and down on a ladder, R resets the current stage without resetting the timer, L completely resets the game to level 1 with 0 seconds on the timer, escape key closes the application, and F toggles fullscreen. I hope you have fun with it!


### DEV NOTE:

  I've had trouble with pyinstaller being detected as virus software when using --onefile to package everything into a single .exe file for user simplicity, so I've had to create build folders/files. It's less convenient but I've compressed them so you can download it as one .rar. Sorry for the inconvenience!
